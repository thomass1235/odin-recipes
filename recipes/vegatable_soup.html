        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Makes approx. 2 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>200g chopped vegetables (such as carrot, celery, leek, onion, etc.)</li>
            <li>300g diced potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>700ml stock (any kind you have, vegetable if you wish recipe to remain vegetarian)</li>
            <li>Creme fraiche and fresh herbs to serve (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh bread to serve (optional, but highly recommended!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the vegetables, potato and oil in a saucepan and fry for a few minutes to soften them slightly.</li>
            <li>Add the stock to the pan and allow to simmer until the vegetables have softened (approximately 10-15 minutes, but check occasionally so they do not become mushy).</li>
            <li>Blend the mixture until smooth (either using a stick blender, or transferring the mixture carefully to a food mixer).</li>
            <li>Transfer the soup to two bowls (or as many bowls as you wish to make portions you believe to be appropriate for you!), then optionally top with creme fraiche and herbs, and enjoy (hopefully with some warm, fresh bread and butter).</li>
        </ol>
